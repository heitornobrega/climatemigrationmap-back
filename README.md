# World Migration Map Backend

World Migration Map Backend is the server-side component of the World Migration Map application, built using Python with the Flex framework. It is an open-source project developed by Heitor Nóbrega Tico and Guillaume Lelasseur. The backend serves as the data processing and API server, providing necessary information to the frontend for visualizing historical migration trends on the interactive world map.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: The backend processes historical migration data and events to provide meaningful information for the frontend visualization.
- **API Endpoints**: Offers various API endpoints to fetch migration data, event details, and other relevant information required for the frontend.
- **Database Connectivity**: Utilizes a database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or others) to store and retrieve migration data efficiently.

## Getting Started with Development

To set up the World Migration Map Backend development environment, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/heitornobrega/worldmigrationmap-back.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd worldmigrationmap-backend
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```
   cd /api && python app.py
   ```

The backend server will now be running and ready to serve API requests.
